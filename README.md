# Inc.5000Dashboard

## Motivation For My Projects:

### Inc. 5000 Dashboard:
### The Inc. 5000 Dashboard was a class project for my Enterprise Data Management course. The motivation for this project was "anyone can analyze data", but throughout the course of the semester, the emphasis was "what can we do to leverage our analysis from a business standpoint". With the Inc. 5000 Dashboard, we focused more on the business decision aspect of data analytics. Using the dashboard, we could check different KPIs such as annual revenue growth rates or even employee turnover rates from thousands of companies in thousands of industries.
